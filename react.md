What is immutability?
An immutable value or object cannot be changed, so every update creates new value, leaving the old one untouched.


What does Object.freeze() do?
A frozen object can no longer be changed; freezing an object prevents new properties from being added to it, existing properties from being removed, prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties, and prevents the values of existing properties from being changed.


Why is immutability required by Redux?
The main reason Redux is using immutability is that it doesn't have to traverse an object tree to check for the changes in every key value. Instead, it will only check the object's reference is changed or not in order to update DOM on state change.



How does Redux use shallow equality checking? â€‹
creates a reference to the current state slice referred to by each key;
calls the appropriate reducer and passes it the slice;
creates a reference to the possibly-mutated state slice that's returned by the reducer.


How does Redux compare to the React Context API?
Both are excellent tools for their own specific niche, Redux is overkill just to pass data from parent to child & Context API truly shines in this case.
